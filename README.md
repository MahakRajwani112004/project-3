- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Multi-agent query routing system

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Add your OpenRouter API key to `.env`:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
```

5. Create resumes directory:
```bash
mkdir resumes
```

6. Start the backend server:
```bash
python main.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
